## Problem Statement

The current method of entering question-wise marks obtained by the students in an
assessment is manual and tedious. Hence, we are looking for an innovative idea to digitize
the process of entering marks in an Application that helps the teacher to enter
question-wise marks obtained by the students in a class assessment. The teacher should
be able to enter the marks in the most time and energy-efficient manner using the latest
technologies like ML, DL, NLP, etc. using mobile or laptop.

## Project Explanation

It is never simple to enter the marks of all the students through traditional data entry.
So we have proposed a solution which makes the data entry simpler and easier.Through this 
solution the data entry can be done through your speech.
The project takes your __SPEECH__ as input and stores the marks of each question in a dictionary.

## Tech Stack
